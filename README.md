# Popular-Movies
An Android application that fetches a list of Popular and Top rated movies based on User selection. Intuitive UI that displays the posters of respective movies and opens up its details to view its summary, rating, trailers, etc.

The landing activity shows a grid of posters of popular movies fetched from the MovieDb API. The posters were populated using Glide.

There is a menu that allows the user to select a list of Popular movies or Top rated movies. In the next version, I will also include an option where a user can also choose to display his own favorites list. Also, I plan to include an endless recyclerview.
